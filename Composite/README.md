ðŸŒ¿ Composite
----------------
## Intent 
Compose objects into three structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individiul objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Explanation
Real world example
> Every sentence is composed of words which are in turn composed of characters.
> Each of these objects is printable and they can have something printed before or
> after them like sentence always ends with full stop and word always has space before it.

In plain words
> Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

Wikipedia says
> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. 
> The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the 
> same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose"
> objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the 
> composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**Programmatic Example**
Taking our sentence example from above. Here we have the base class and different 
printable types

```c

```


And then it can be used as 
```c

```

## Applicability
Use the Composite pattern when
* you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference 
between compositions of objects and individual objects.
Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly
