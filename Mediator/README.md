Mediator
-------------

## Intent 
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring 
to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction 
independently.

In plain words
> Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to 
> control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues).
> It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating 
> with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge
> of each other's implementation.
